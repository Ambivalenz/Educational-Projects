# Educational projects
## 1. Application with the [simplest console menu](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_1/SimpleConsoleApp)
* ### [Count](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_1/FunctionalLibrary/AlgorithmicOperations.cs) a number from 1 to N
* ### [Draws](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_1/FunctionalLibrary/GeometricShapes.cs) a square that is a multiple of the number 3.
---
## 2. An [application](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_2/DataTypesConsoleApp) with a [functional library](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_2/DataTypesLibrary)
* ### Calculate the number of repetitions of words in the text. 
* ### Calculate BMI (body mass index) based on the parameters entered by the user: Weight and Height. 
* ### Generates an array with random elements, the length is equal to an integer entered by the user. Finds the minimum and maximum array element, sorts the array and outputs the basic information and sorted array to the user. 
* ### The "User" structure has been created.
* ### To test the console application, GarbageCollector is used, after each manipulation with the library, the memory size is displayed before and after cleaning. 
---
## 3. [Library](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_3/LibraryCollections) for interacting with [collections](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_3/CollectionsDevConsoleApp)
* ### Calculates the frequency of repetition of words in the text. 
* ### Implementation of its dynamic array. The default length is 8. Implements the basic IEnumerable interface. There is a possibility of both adding a single number, adding a range of numbers, deleting and inserting elements into a certain index. There are methods for comparing Equals and transforming an array to a string representation. 
---
## 4. [Events and Delegates](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_4/ConsoleDelegatesApp)
* ### The sorting [library](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_4/LibraryDelegates) provides the following methods:
    * ### Sorting start and end events. 
    * ### Sorting the array. 
    * ### Output of the array to the screen. 
---
## 5. Working with [Json](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_5/ConsoleJsonApp)
* ### Library for working with serialization and deserialization
* ### Serialization of the "Author" object 
* ### Writing information about the author to a Json file.
* ### Reading information about the author from a file. 
---
## 6. [Linq expressions](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_6/ConsoleLinq)
* ### [Movie class](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_6/ConsoleLinq/Movie.cs) - parses data from a csv file with movie statistics from the top 250 kinopoisk.
* ### Displays a list of films whose year is > 1950.  Sorts the rating in descending order and outputs the first 50.
* ### Outputs all unique movies and sorts them by country, which is equal to "USSR"
* ### Displays all films whose country is "Germany". Sorts by rating. 
* ### Displays all films whose year is > 1980 and director = David Fincher

## 7. [Object-oriented programming](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_7/ConsoleOOPApp)
* ### [Coordinate](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_7/ConsoleOOPApp/Coordinate.cs) structure along the X and Y axes.
* ### [User](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_7/ConsoleOOPApp/User.cs) class contains the first name, last name, patronymic, date of birth, age, constructor and toString method.
* ### [Employee](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_7/ConsoleOOPApp/Employee.cs) class, which is inherited from the user base class. Contains work experience, position.
* ### [IPhilosophicalThinking](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_7/ConsoleOOPApp/IPhilosophicalThinking.cs) interface.
* ### An abstract [Philosopher](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_7/ConsoleOOPApp/Philosopher.cs) class that inherits from the interface. Contains the name of the philosopher
* ### [Kant]((https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_7/ConsoleOOPApp/Kant.cs)) class, inherited from the philosopher, it defines the name and philosophical school.
* ### [Round]((https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_7/ConsoleOOPApp/Round.cs)) class. Contains the center of the circle, its length, area, radius, and appropriate methods for calculating its characteristics.
---
## 8. [Date converter](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_8/ConsoleDateApp) 
* ### Converts the date from UTC format to local time.
---
## 9. [File operations](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/tree/master/Project_9/ConsoleInteractingFilesApp)
* ### [File copying](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_9/ConsoleInteractingFilesApp/FileCopier.cs) - implements copying bytes from one file to another, writing to the file and its end. There are events for the start and end of the operation.

* ### [File Reading](https://github.com/Ambivalenz/Educational-Projects/blob/master/Project_9/ConsoleInteractingFilesApp/FileReading.cs) - implements file reading in byte representation.
